    overview: I led a small team of research assistants on mosquito-borne virus surveillance and mosquito metagenomic next generation sequencing projects. 
              My team and I collected and identified **~300,000 mosquitoes**, identified the presence of Cache Valley virus in mosquitoes in Manitoba, and identified **66
              viruses** being harboured by mosquitoes in Manitoba including **17 novel viruses**.
  positions:
  - designation: Graduate Researcher
    start: April 2020
    end: June 2022
    responsibilities:
    - Planned, organized, and managed all facets of several research projects related to mosquito surveillance, including leading a team of research assistants.
    - Developed and authored standard operating procedures for mosquito trapping, identification, RNA isolation and RT-PCR. 
    - Optimized insect RNA isolation and RT-PCR protocols, increasing RNA yield and quality and RT-PCR sensitivity. 
    - Carried out, trained, and mentored staff on mosquito trapping, identification, RNA isolation and RT-PCR. We trapped, identified and processed ~300,000 mosquitoes over two years, resulting in the detection of Cache Valley Virus in two mosquito pools.
    - Led data analysis for mosquito-borne pathogen surveillance, including modelling trap count data and weather (using R), and conducting a mosquito metatranscriptomic analysis (using various bioinformatics tools including R, CLC Genomics Workbench, Bowtie2, Trimmomatic) identifying 66 viruses, including 17 novel viruses, using next-generation sequencing.
    - Authored weekly, monthly and annual reports detailing trap counts, virus surveillance results, and recommendations for how the public can protect themselves from mosquito bites to local municipalities, Manitoba Health and the Public Health Agency of Canada.
