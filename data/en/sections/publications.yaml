    summary: Black queen cell virus (BQCV) is a ubiquitous honeybee virus and a significant pathogen to queen bee (Apis mellifera) larvae. However, many aspects of the virus remain poorly understood, including the transmission dynamics. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to identify BQCV in Aedes vexans (n = 4,000) collected in 2019 and 2020 from Manitoba, Canada. We assembled de novo the nearly complete (>96%) genome sequence of the virus, which is the first available from North America and the first report of BQCV being harbored by mosquitoes. Phylogenetic tree reconstructions indicated that the genome had 95.5% sequence similarity to a BQCV isolate from Sweden. Sequences of a potential vector (Varroa destructor) and a microsporidian associated with BQCV (Nosema apis) were not identified in the mosquito samples, however, we did detect sequences of plant origin. We, therefore, hypothesize that the virus was indirectly acquired by mosquitoes foraging at the same nectar sources as honeybees.

  paper:
    summary: Mosquito seasonal activity is largely driven by weather conditions, most notably temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity. The extent by which these weather variables influence activity is intertwined with the animal’s biology and may differ by species. For mosquito vectors, changes in weather can also alter host–pathogen interactions thereby increasing or decreasing the burden of disease.

    summary: Accepted by mSphere in May 2024. The microbiome plays vital roles in the life history of mosquitoes, including their development, immunity, longevity, and vector competence. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have allowed for detailed exploration into the diverse microorganisms harboured by these medically important insects. Although these meta-studies have catalogued the microbiomes of mosquitoes on several continents, much of the information currently available for North America is limited to the state of California. In this study, we collected >35,000 mosquitoes throughout Manitoba, Canada over a two-year period, and then harnessed RNA sequencing and targeted RT-PCR to characterize the microbiomes of the eight most pervasive and important vector and pest species. The consensus microbiome of each species was overwhelmingly composed of viruses, but also included fungi, bacteria, protozoa, and parasitic invertebrates. The microbial assemblages were heterogeneous between species, even within the same genus. We detected notable pathogens, including the causal agents of Cache Valley Fever, avian malaria, and canine heartworm. The remaining microbiome consisted largely of putatively insect-specific viruses that are not well characterized, including 17 newly discovered viruses from 10 different families. Future research should focus on evaluating the potential application of these viruses in biocontrol, as biomarkers, and/or in disrupting mosquito vectorial capacity. Interestingly, we also detected viruses that naturally infect honeybees and thrips, which were presumably acquired indirectly through nectar foraging behaviours. Overall, we provide the first comprehensive catalogue of the microorganisms harboured by the most common and important mosquito vectors and pests in the Canadian Prairies.
