  paper: 
    summary: Black queen cell virus (BQCV) is a ubiquitous honeybee virus and a significant pathogen to queen bee (Apis mellifera) larvae. However, many aspects of the virus remain poorly understood, including the transmission dynamics. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to identify BQCV in Aedes vexans (n = 4,000) collected in 2019 and 2020 from Manitoba, Canada. We assembled de novo the nearly complete (>96%) genome sequence of the virus, which is the first available from North America and the first report of BQCV being harbored by mosquitoes. Phylogenetic tree reconstructions indicated that the genome had 95.5% sequence similarity to a BQCV isolate from Sweden. Sequences of a potential vector (Varroa destructor) and a microsporidian associated with BQCV (Nosema apis) were not identified in the mosquito samples, however, we did detect sequences of plant origin. We, therefore, hypothesize that the virus was indirectly acquired by mosquitoes foraging at the same nectar sources as honeybees.

  paper:
    summary: Mosquito seasonal activity is largely driven by weather conditions, most notably temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity. The extent by which these weather variables influence activity is intertwined with the animal’s biology and may differ by species. For mosquito vectors, changes in weather can also alter host–pathogen interactions thereby increasing or decreasing the burden of disease.
