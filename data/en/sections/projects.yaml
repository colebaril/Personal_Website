  summary: Led a metagenomic next-generation sequencing project on mosquitoes in Manitoba. We have identified **66 viruses** being harboured by mosquitoes including **17 novel viruses**. My work was published in [*mSphere* in 2024](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msphere.00203-24) and resulted in a short communication in the [*Journal of Insect Science* in 2023](https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/23/2/10/7099533).

  summary: Led a mosquito surveillance project over two years. My team and I trapped and identified **~300,000 mosquitoes** in Manitoba and described the relationships between trap counts and weather through GLMMs. Our work was published in [*Parasites & Vectors* in 2022](https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13071-023-05760-x).

  summary: Led a targeted RT-PCR California Serogroup Virus surveillance project in Manitoba. Over summers in 2020 and 2021, mosquitoes were trapped twice weekly in >8 communities in Manitoba. Specimens were identified and RNA isolations were carried out followed by RT-PCR. Two positive pools were identified, one confirmed to be Cache Valley virus by Sanger sequencing.
