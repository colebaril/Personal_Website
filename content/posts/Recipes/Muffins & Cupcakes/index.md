{{< /alert >}}

**Methods**

1. Heat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. For big-topped muffins, line 8 standard-size muffin cups with paper liners. For standard-size muffins line 10 muffin cups. 
2. Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
3. Combine oil, egg, milk and vanilla. Whisk to combine.
4. Add milk mixture to the bowl with dry ingredients then use a fork to combine. Do not over mix. (The muffin batter will be quite thick — see note below for more details). Fold in the blueberries.
