## Moist Chocolate Cake & Frosting

*Cole Baril*

**Ingredients**

Cake:

- 1¾ cups all purpose flour
- 2 cups granulated white sugar
- 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1½ tsp. baking soda
- ¾ tsp. salt
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup buttermilk 
- 1/2 cup butter melted
- 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract
- 1 cup hot coffee

Frosting:

- 340g dark/bittersweet chocolate 60-70% cocoa, chopped
- 227g unsalted butter room temperature
- 1/4 cup cocoa powder either natural or dutch process are fine
- 1/2 cup icing sugar
- A pinch salt
- 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup whipping cream

**Methods**

Cake:

1. Preheat oven to 350ºF. Grease and flour two 9-inch baking pans (or line with parchment paper circles) and set aside.
2. In the large bowl of a standing mixer, combine flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, and salt on low speed for one minute.
3. Add eggs, buttermilk, melted butter and vanilla extract and beat on medium speed until batter forms, about 30 seconds. Pause to scrape down sides and bottom of mixer bowl as well as the paddle. Beat 15 seconds more, until mixture is mostly smooth.
4. Remove bowl from mixer and stir in hot coffee with a rubber spatula. Batter will be very runny.
5. Pour batter evenly between the two pans and bake on middle rack of oven for 25-35 minutes, until thermometer inserted in the middle reaches 190ºF.
6. Allow to cool 15 minutes in pans, then run a butter knife around the edges of each cake. Line two cooling racks with parchment paper. (See note)
7. Place a cooling rack over top of each pan. Wearing oven mitts, use both hands to hold the racks in place while flipping the cakes over onto the racks. Set the racks down and gently thump on the bottom of the pans until the cakes release. Cool completely before handling or frosting.

Frosting:

1. Melt the chocolate in the microwave on 50% power in 30 second increments, stirring each time - stop when it's about 70% melted, and stir vigorously to melt the rest. In my microwave, it took a total of 2 1/2 minutes. (Alternatively, melt in a heat-proof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water - careful not to get a single drop of water in the bowl, or chocolate will seize). Allow chocolate to cool to room temperature.
2. Combine butter, cocoa powder, confectioners' sugar and salt in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat on medium speed until well combined, about a minute. Reduce speed to low and incorporate vanilla extract, whipping cream and cooled chocolate, then turn speed back up to medium and beat for about 5 minutes, until pale and very fluffy. Pipe (I used Wilton Large Open Star tip) or spread onto fully cooled cake or cupcakes.
3. Frosting may be made up to 48 hours in advance - refrigerate until needed, then bring back to room temperature and beat again for a minute or two before using. Frosted cake may be stored at room temperature for up to two days - if it'll take you longer to eat, god bless your willpower and store the cake in the fridge.

## Moist Carrot Cake 

**Ingredients**

Cake:

- 2 cups (260 grams) all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 ¼ cups (295 ml) canola or other vegetable oil
- 1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar
- 1 cup (190 grams) lightly packed brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4 large eggs, at room temperature
- 3 cups (300 grams) grated peeled carrots, 5 to 6 medium carrots

Frosting:

- 8 ounces (225 grams) cream cheese, at room temperature
- 1 ¼ cups (140 grams) powdered sugar
- 1/3 cup (80 ml) cold heavy whipping cream

**Methods**

1. Position a rack in the middle of the oven. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans. Grease and flour the bottom and sides of both pans.
2. Heat the oven to 350ºF.
3. Whisk flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl until very well blended.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk the oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla.
5. Add the eggs, one at a time, whisking after each one.
6. Switch to a large rubber spatula. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, then add the dry ingredients in three parts, gently stirring until they disappear and the batter is smooth.
7. Stir in the carrots.
8. Divide the cake batter between the prepared cake pans.
9. Bake until the tops of the cake layers are springy when touched and when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes.
10. Cool cakes in the pans for 15 minutes, then carefully turn the cake layers out onto cooling racks.  
11. In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese with a handheld mixer on medium speed until creamy, about 1 minute.
12. Beat in the powdered sugar, a 1/4 cup at a time, until fluffy.
13. Pour in the whipping cream. Beat on medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the frosting is whipped and creamy. This frosting resembles the texture of whipped cream. Chill covered until ready to frost the cake.
14. When the cake layers are completely cool, frost the cake.

2. 180 ml Sour Cream - at room temperature

**Methods**

Biscoff Cookie Crust

1. Melt the Butter in a small mixing bowl and set aside to cool down.
2. Finely crush the Biscoff Cookies, either in the food processor or by placing them inside a freezing bag and crushing them with a rolling pin. Add the crumbs to the melted butter and stir with a spatula until combined. It should have the consistency of wet sand.
3. Prepare a Muffin Pan or Mini Cheesecake Pan with paper muffin liners. Scoop the crust mixture into the muffin liners and press the crumbs well to pack them tightly, using either your fingers, the back of a spoon or the bottom of a cup. Place in the fridge to chill.

Biscoff Cheesecake

1. Preheat your oven on 140 degree Celsius / 285 degree Fahrenheit.
2. Place the room temperature Cream Cheese and Sour Cream in a large mixing bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer. Mix for a few minutes until no lumps remain and the mixture is smooth (see note 1).
3. Add the melted Biscoff Spread, Brown Sugar and Speculoos Spice. Mix until just combined. Add the Eggs and slowly mix them in, stopping as soon as combine to avoid creating too many air bubbles.
4. Scoop the cream cheese mixture over the chilled crust. Tap the muffin tin on a hard surface a few times to pop any air bubbles remaining in the mixture.
5. Bake on the lowest rack of your oven for 20 to 25 minutes. The filling should be slightly wobbly in the centre. Turn off the oven, slightly open the door and let the mini cheesecakes cool down for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven, leave at room temperature for another 30 minutes before transferring in the fridge for at least 1 more hour.

Biscoff Whipped Cream Topping

1. For the glaze: Melt the Biscoff Spread (1) until warm and very liquid. Remove the paper liners from the cheesecakes (optional) then pour a little bit of the spread over each cheesecakes. Place in the fridge to allow for the glaze to set.
2. For the whipped cream: Slightly melt the Biscoff Spread (2) until fluid, then set aside to cool down for a few minutes.
3. Place the cold Cream in a large mixing bowl and pour in the Biscoff Spread. Using a mixer, whip on medium to medium high speed until you reach stiff peaks. Place in the fridge.
4. Put the Whipped Cream in a piping bag with a start nozzle and pipe it over the cheesecakes. Finish each cheesecakes with a sprinkle of crushed biscoff cookies (optional) and half of a cookie pressed into the whipped cream.
