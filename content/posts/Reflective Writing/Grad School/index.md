## Introduction

During my Master's Degree in Environmental and Life Sciences, I had the extraordinary opportunity to immerse myself in the captivating world of mosquitoes, molecular diagnostics, and virus discovery. Driven by an insatiable curiosity to unravel the intricacies of vector-borne pathogens and their impact on public health, I eagerly embarked on this academic journey, brimming with anticipation and unaware of the remarkable hardships, achievements, personal growth, and lasting impact that awaited me.

As I delved deeper into my studies, I encountered a multitude of challenges that tested my resolve and resilience. From complex laboratory techniques to the demands of rigorous data analysis, each hurdle presented a chance for growth. The countless hours spent meticulously collecting and analyzing samples, painstakingly deciphering genetic codes, and navigating the intricacies of scientific literature taught me invaluable lessons in patience, meticulousness, and the importance of perseverance in the face of adversity.

However, amidst the hardships, there were victories and moments of profound accomplishment that fueled my motivation and validated my chosen path. I vividly recall the exhilaration I felt when I successfully identified a previously unknown virus in mosquitoes, contributing to the expanding knowledge of vector-borne diseases. It was a testament to my dedication, hard work, and the boundless possibilities that lie within the realm of scientific discovery. These triumphs not only bolstered my confidence but also instilled in me a profound sense of purpose and the desire to make a tangible difference in the realm of public health.

As I reflect on the challenges overcome and the victories achieved during my Master's degree, I am humbled by the profound impact that this academic journey has had on my understanding, my passion, and my sense of purpose. With a solid foundation built upon the captivating world of mosquitoes, molecular diagnostics, and virus discovery, I now eagerly embrace the next chapter of my story, armed with newfound knowledge, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to exploring the uncharted territories that lie ahead.

## Prelude

After graduating with my Bachelor of Science in Biology in 2019, I eagerly anticipated entering the professional world and embarking on a new chapter of my life. However, the reality of facing numerous job rejections and an overwhelming sense of uncertainty left me grappling with internal struggles. With each application rejection and employer silence, my confidence wavered, and I found myself questioning my intelligence, personality, and self-worth. These experiences gradually eroded the confidence I had built throughout my undergraduate studies, leaving me at a crossroads of self-doubt and a quest for personal growth and resilience. As desperation grew, I found myself accepting a minimum-wage position in a factory setting out of necessity. While initially hopeful that this job could suffice, deep down, I knew I was destined for more. The mounting anxiety that accompanied this role and the fear of being trapped in such a role forever gradually consumed me, ultimately culminating in an overwhelming, multi-day panic attack. During those harrowing days, I experienced a profound sense of paralysis, unable to think or move, and I found myself confined to a couch for three agonizing days, gripped by immobilizing anxiety.

These events served as a catalyst for me to reach out to someone I deeply trusted and respected, my former professor, Dr. Ren√©e Douville. Having previously supported me through mental health challenges during my time in her classes, I knew she could provide valuable guidance. While her words helped to ground me, it was her thoughtful recommendation of a professor whom I eventually completed my Master's degree with that truly set my career in motion, igniting a transformative journey of personal and professional growth.

## The Beginning

When I received my acceptance letter for the Master of Science program at Brandon University, I was elated. However, now a new set of anxieties plagued me: where was I going to live? How would I cope living two and a half hours away from my family and friends? Am I smart enough? And, to top it off, I did not really know what project I was even working on yet nor was aware of the details or what would all be involved. 

Luckily, I have great parents and they helped me find a place and move to Brandon, two and a half hours from Winnipeg.
